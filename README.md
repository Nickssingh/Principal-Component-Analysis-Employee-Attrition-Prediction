# Principal Component Analysis - IBM Employee Attrition

## A. Goal
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the number of features needed to be used in a prediction model. In this exercise, we will see the impact of PCA – in terms of accuracy and time needed to train – on models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
